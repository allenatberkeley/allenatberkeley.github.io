    <h2 align="middle">Part 1: Tracing Rays through Lenses</h2>
    <p>There are many differences between a pinhole camera (as in the previous project) and a fully simulated lens system (as in this project). Firstly, a pinhole camera has no lens, and in real life, a pinhole camera is subject to light diffraction effects. A lens system can converge light without reducing the amount of light in the scene. Using a lens system, a camera can focus on individual objects and blur other parts of the scene. Unlike a pinhole camera, a lens camera has a variable aperture, which allows the amount of light coming into the sensor to be adjusted. Also unlike a pinhole camera, a lens camera has adjustable perspectives, for example, one can have wide angle lenses, fisheye lenses, or telephoto lenses, all of which have different effects on the image. The wide angle lenses capture more horizontal space in the world, fisheye lenses capture a wide hemisphere of the world, and telephoto lenses capture far away (small angle) images of the world. Additionally, lens cameras can produce aberrations, such as circles of confusion and bokeh. Lenses can also be manipulated during the capturing of an image to produce interesting effects, like tilt-shift photography, which makes scenes appear minature. In real life, both pinhole and (single) lens cameras capture images upside-down to the world.</p>

The entire dragon here is fairly in focus. However, subjectively the middle curve of the dragon's body appears to be slightly more in focus than the rest of it. Since this is a fish eye lens, a larger hemisphere of the scene is captured compared to the other lenses. Characteristic of this lens type is that the edges of the image (areas with a large angle to the z-axis) are warped and stretched out. This effect can be seen be examining the edges of the Cornell box where the walls meet: these edges turn out to be curved lines rather than straight lines.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 2: Contrast-based autofocus</h2>
    <p>My autofocus algorithm is composed of two parts: a variance-based focus metric and the autofocus heuristic. The algorithm runs on a small cell in the scene to find the sensor depth that best focuses that part of the image.</p>
    <p>For my focus metric, I am calculating the RGB variance of the cell. Provided an ImageBuffer of RGB values, the metric first iterates through the buffer and sums up all of the color values in each channel. Then the sums of each color channel is divided by the number of pixels in the ImageBuffer (simply <em>width * height</em>). This gives us the average value of each color channel. Using these mean values, the metric iterates through the ImageBuffer once again, this time summing up the squared differences of each color channel. (For example for the Red channel, <em>vsum_r += (r - x_r) * (r - x_r);</em> where <em>vsum_r</em> is the running sum, <em>r</em> is the red value of the current pixel, and <em>x_r</em> is the previously calculated mean red value.) After iterating through the ImageBuffer, the 3 sums of squared differences of the channels are all added together and divided by the total number of pixels in the ImageBuffer. This value, the Variance of the RGB channels, is returned.</p>
    <p>This Variance captures the idea of "focus" in the image cell. This is because, what humans view as an image being in focus is that the image is "sharp." An in-focus image has objects with edges that are clearly visible: the object in the foreground contrasts with the background of the scene. In terms of signal-processing, there are many high-frequency signals in the focused part of the scene. For an out-of-focus image, edges are blurry and objects are indistinct from the background. There are few high-frequency signals in the scene. In terms of my metric, the Variance calculated above captures the idea of quantifying the relative amount of high-frequency signals in the cell. So, if we maximize Variance, we also tend to maximize the number of high-frequency signals, leading to high visual contrast, and therefore the image is in focus.</p>
    <p>My autofocus heuristic seeks to maximize the Variance value calculated above. First, the <em>sensor_depth</em> is initialized to be at the len's sensor-depth value <em>infinity_focus</em>. Then the initial step size is set to be the len's sensor-depth values <em>0.75 * (near_focus - infinity_focus)</em>. (The 0.75 was arbitrarily chosen such that the step size is between the two focusing depths: this way the step size is neither too big or too small.) Two variables record the maximum variance achieved and the depth at which that maximum variance was achieved. Then while the step size is greater than 0.005 (millimeters), we loop: (I) one step size is added to <em>sensor_depth</em>; (IIA) if the variance is increased in the cell, record the current state and maximum values, and continue the loop to step again; (IIB) otherwise if the variance is decreased after stepping, keep the current <em>sensor_depth</em> step, divide the step size by negative two, and loop to step again using the new step size. My algorithm divides the step size by negative two in order to (1) decrease the step size and (2) reverse the direction of stepping. My justification for keeping the "missteps," when the <em>sensor_depth</em> is overstepped and the variance decreases, and reversing directions, is to try to avoid local maxima "traps" in variances.^* The loop breaks when the step size is below 0.005 mm. Then, the <em>sensor_depth</em> is finally assigned to be the depth at which the maximum variance was recorded. The cell is then in focus.</p>
    <p>^* My algorithm weakly protects against the local maxima when trying to find the global maximum in variance. When an overstep occurs, the variance is less than before the step. However, the <em>sensor_depth</em> values is kept, and we instead step backwards. If the global maximum was jumped over, then variance should increase once again while stepping backwards and we eventually reach the global maximum as intended. If a local maximum was jumped over, stepping backwards may indicate another decrease in variance, in which case direction is reversed again and we step forwards to increasing variance. Hopefully, the new stepping forwards will lead to the global maximum. It is possible to keep jumping over local maxima, but it is unlikely due to the continually decreasing step size.</p>

The focusing was done on the dragon's horns, but the rest of the dragon is fairly in focus as well.

Because the fisheye lens captures a large hemisphere of the scene, the center of the image appears fairly realstic in proportions while the edges are out of proportion. The edges of the Cornell box are curved rather than straight.</figcaption>

    <h2 align="middle">Part 3: Faster contrast-based autofocus (Extra credit)</h2>
    <p>As explained in Part 2, my original algorithm weakly protects against falling into local minima traps. In contrast to the naive approach of not keeping oversteps and never reversing directions in stepping, my algorithm tends to find better quality focusing depths. The outcome tends to be better using about the same amount of time.</p>
    <p>For creating the following two images, I had modified my algorithm to the naive approach. I am focusing on the top of the middle bump of the dragon:</p>

        <img class="img-responsive img-fluid center-block" src="images/3-max1.png"/>
        <figcaption class="figure-caption">The naive algorithm. It seems that the specular shine of the metal produced a large enough variance to trap the <em>sensor_depth</em> step-based traversal. As a result, the image is blurry except for the large splotches of reflected light.</figcaption>
